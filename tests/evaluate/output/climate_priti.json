    "question": "What are the benefits of electrifying every sector? What are the sectors which\nare harder to electrify in the present times?",
    "answer": "The benefits of electrifying every sector are reducing the CO2 emissions\nupto an extent. There will be less polluting sectors if they are electrified. There will be\nreduction in the greenhouse gases that can be trapped in the atmosphere. This will also\nreduce the dependencies on the fossil fuel. It will enhance the energy efficiencies compared\nto the combustion based technologies. Furthermore, if it is integrated with renewable 2\nenergy like solar or wind then the air quality will also be improved as these are one of the\nnon-polluting sources of renewable energy. Sectors that are harder to electrify are industries\nlike steel, cement and any chemical production industries as they come under heavy\nindustry categories as their energy requirement is very high.",

    "text_feedback": "The answer clearly explains the benefits of electrifying every sector, including reduction in CO2 emissions, improved air quality, reduced dependence on fossil fuels, and increased energy efficiency.

This\nbasically is the melting of ice reduces the reflectivity, absorbing more heat and causes more\nmelting. Negative feedback loop is when it reduces the warming. For example there is\nincreased plant growth that will absorb the CO2 which will eventually reduce the atmospheric\nCO2 present.\nTipping points are referred to as irreversible climate shifts. Examples are Amazon rainforest\nwhere the deforestation and drought are turning the rainforest into savanna. Another\nexample is the Greenland ice sheet melting where there is irreversible ice loss happening\nand it is leading to the sea-level rise.",

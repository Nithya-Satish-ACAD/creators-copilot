    "question": "What are the benefits of electrifying every sector? What are the sectors which\nare harder to electrify in the present times?",
    "answer": "Electrifying every sector ensures that low carbon emissions are maintained\nas almost all sectors use electricity out of which 70% comes from burning of fossil fuel based\nresources like coal & petrols. In present times Industry is harder to electrify as it requires\nhigh amount of energy to power boilers used in manifacturing & heating. Transportation like\nheavy weigh transportation of goods using ships or Airplanes can be also a difficult sector as\nthere are technological limitations for engines or fuels used.",

    "question": "How will climate change impact crop yields and nutritional quality?",
    "answer": "Climate change events like droughts, high percipitation or heat can impact\ncrop yeild.\n- Water rich crops like rice will be heavily impacted by droughts as there will be water\nscarcity.\n- Minerals retained by soil will be highly impacted by heat waves as they will result in soil\nerosion. This will in turn affect nutritional quality as minerals present in soil would be less &\nalso moisture retained in soil would be less.",
